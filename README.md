# Cheap and FAIR: A Serverless Research Data Repository

This project presents a prototype data repository that combines [Globus](https://globus.org) for authentication, authorization, and data access with a static web interface for browsing the available datasets and their metadata. This infrastructure brings together the power of the Globus platform with the simplicity and low-maintenance of a static website generation software (Jekyll).
